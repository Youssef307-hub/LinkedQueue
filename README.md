# LinkedQueue
*Linked Queue implementation*

**The Queue is a First In First Out *(FIFO)* data structure used to solve various problems**

## In this project I implemented the main queue methods which are:
- **enqueue**: Method to add items to the end of the queue.
- **dequeue**: Method to remove items from the begginning of the queue.
- **getFront**: Method to display the front item in the queue.
- **getRear**: Method to display the rear item in the queue.
- **empty**: Method to check whether the queue is empty or not.
- **getSize**: Method to get the size of the queue.
- **elements**: Method to display all the items in the queue.
- **clear**: Method to remove all the items from the queue.
